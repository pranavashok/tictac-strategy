Tic Tac Toe, Game tree + strategy finding mission

The idea is to build a game tree of tic tac toe (depicting all automorphisms of a particular configuration as a single configuration) and the try find optimal strategies for the players.

Part 1 is probably complete, need to verify whether it's giving the full tree. Part 2 needs to be worked on. Especially propogating the win upward through the tree.
